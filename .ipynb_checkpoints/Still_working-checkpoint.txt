I apologize sincerely for the late submission! I don't wish to offer excessive excuses; however, the intense and challenging nature of recent work tasks have made it hard for me to find a breather, inadvertently causing me to forget about this project. Given my tight schedule today, I can only prioritize completing the data portion initially, with the finalized PDF display likely to take a bit more time. I'll make sure to provide updates as soon as possible. I appreciate your understanding and patience!
